Play-Along-Together (PAT) is a web app designed for real-time collaboration and teacher/student interaction.

It features automatic analysis of backing tracks for rhythm and harmony, supports playing along and overlaying recordings (overdubbing), and allows creating and using mix-downs from selected tracks as new backing tracks.

Demo video of the application is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHTpEF6bQZg&t=4s)
